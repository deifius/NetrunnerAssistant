Helps to guide set acquisition based off decks designed

This script is for the thrifty Netrunner who wants competetive decks without having to purchase all the expansions.

Supply the script with a list of sets you currently own and the collection of decks you've designed on netrunnerdb.com. 
Deckpairset.py will check pairs of runner + corp decks you've designed and let you know which you are closest to completing.
